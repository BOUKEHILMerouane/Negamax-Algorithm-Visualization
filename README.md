# Negamax-Algorithm-Visualization

This Python script, utilizing the Processing library, visualizes a game tree with a negamax algorithm. The game tree represents a decision-making process with different levels (depths) and values associated with each node. The script dynamically displays the decision-making process, highlighting the chosen path and associated values.

Instructions

Requirements:
Python with the Processing library installed.

Setup:
Ensure you have the Processing library installed for Python.
Run the script in a Python environment.

Usage:
Observe the negamax algorithm in action, visualized using circles and lines.
The script dynamically displays the decision-making process.

Visualization:
The script utilizes the Processing library for visualization.
Circles represent decision points, and lines connect the nodes to show the tree structure.
The script highlights the chosen path and displays the associated values.

Algorithm:

The negamax algorithm is implemented for educational purposes to demonstrate decision-making in a game tree.

Acknowledgments:
The visualization is based on the negamax algorithm, a variation of the minimax algorithm.

Note:
Feel free to experiment with different tree structures, levels, and values.
